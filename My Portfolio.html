        <h1>RABDEEP SINGH'S PORTFOLIO</h1>
        <hr>
        I am a full stack developer currently pursuing Btech in CSE at the prestigious 
        Jaype Institute of information and technology sector - 62, Noida. I'd like to claim my proficiency in backend languages like c++ and popular front end languages like html and css(add more to the list as soon as you learn them for satisfaction) which are commensurate to the current industry standards/requirements.
